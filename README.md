- 👋 Hi, I’m @reisTaylor. I'm making a career pivot from online education to software development.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning faster, more productive ways of doing things. I hope to find opportunities to help my fellow candidates to successfully complete the Revature       training. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Git CLI, and HTML/CSS with Bootstrap. 
- 💞️ I’ve been looking forward to the year of the tiger.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email: it@teacherreis.com
