Greetings! My name is Reis Taylor and I'm currently making a career pivot from teacher to Salesforce developer. As a family man, the decision to pursue a career in software development was helped along by the promise of financial gain, but the promise of money only helped make the decision. What drives me to work as hard as I do, is something else entirely.

Before the degrees in Education and Business, I used to be a Computer Science major. I had excellent grades too. The thrill and outright surprise of finding that I fit in with a room full of highly intelligent peers immediately told me that I'd found the right place. It wasn't long before I found myself applying the leadership and interpersonal skills I'd learned previously to bring value to the group, and with each passing term we became a more effective team. It also became easier to see how I could fit in with and contribute to much larger projects that brought real value to the world.

I was about half-way through my program when my wife and I found out that we would soon be parents. 

Being a Computer Science student was important to me, but my wife and I were young. She soon stopped working and my becoming a software engineer was at odds with our more immediate, fundamental duties. It was money that ultimately made that decision, too. I'm becoming a Salesforce developer today because Revature has put me in a position where money is no longer an obstacle to pursue the best version of myself that I've ever met.
