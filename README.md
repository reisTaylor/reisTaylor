- 👋 Hi, I’m @reisTaylor. I live in Oregon but have lived in 6 states including Texas and every state that touches the Pacific Ocean. 
     I've also spent six years living in Bangkok, Thailand.
- 👀 I’m interested in helping my fellow students in the Revature training. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Git CLI utility, and trying to prepare for my upcoming ten-week, intensive training.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever projects the Revature trainers assign, where ethical to do so.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email: it@teacherreis.com
