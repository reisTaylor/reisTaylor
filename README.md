After nearly a decade in the Education industry, this family man is making a bold career pivot to Salesforce developer. My decision to pursue software development was certainly helped along by the promise of financial gain, but that hopeful promise merely helped make the decision. Before the degrees in Education and Business I was a Computer Science major. As an extrovert that didn't play video games it was a relief to find that I fit-in well with my peers. It wasn't long before I found that the group was sorely missing the very leadership and interpersonal skills that I had to offer, and we became a more effective and cohesive group with each passing term. I began to envision myself fitting-in with and contributing to much larger projects that would bring real value to the world.

I was about half-way through my undergraduate coursework when my wife and I found out that we would soon be parents. 

Being a Computer Science student was important to me, but my wife and I were so young. She soon stopped working and my becoming a software engineer was suddenly at odds with more immediate and fundamental duties. It was money that helped that decision along, too. Now, money is no longer an obstacle keeping me from pursuing the best version of myself I've ever met.
