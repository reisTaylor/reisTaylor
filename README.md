Greetings! My name is Reis Taylor and I'm currently making a career pivot from teacher to Salesforce developer. As a family man, the decision to pursue software development was helped along by the promise of financial gain, but that hopeful promise merely helped make the decision. Before the degrees in Education and Business I used to be a Computer Science major. As an extrovert that didn't play video games it was thrilling to find that I fit-in there with my peers. It wasn't long before I found that the group was sorely missing the very leadership and interpersonal skills that I had to offer, and with each passing term we became a more effective team. It also became easier to envision myself fitting-in with and contributing to much larger projects that would bring real value to the world.

I was about half-way through my program when my wife and I found out that we would soon be parents. 

Being a Computer Science student was important to me, but my wife and I were young. She soon stopped working and my becoming a software engineer was suddenly at odds with more immediate and fundamental duties. It was money that helped that decision along, too. With Revature, money is no longer an obstacle keeping me from pursuing the best version of myself I've ever met.
