Greetings! My name is Reis Taylor and I'm currently making a career pivot from teacher to Salesforce developer. I’m fascinated with the growth potential of the human mind and often dismayed at my inability to swing a golfclub without slicing the ball to the right. Fun fact: I used up almost every one of the pages in my first US passport by the time I was 24 years old. Now a husband and father, border check-points and cozy hostels have long since been replaced with movie nights and family dinners. The best reach me is through my email: it@teacherreis.com, but you can also count on me to pick up the phone if you call.

Listed below are some of the highlights of my life.
  -Correcting a professor's six-year-old presentation slide on Demorgan's Theorem using a mathematical proof in front of the entire class.
  -Hearing the Oregon Secretary of State say, "I've heard so much about you!" while shaking my hand for the first time.
  -Standing by my little brother's side as we watched his wife-to-be make her way down the aisle.
  -Watching my wife smile for pictures with local officials upon making her donation of winter coats for an entire school.
